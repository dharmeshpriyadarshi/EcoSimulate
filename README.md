EcoSimulate
EcoSimulate is a web-based pollution mitigation simulation platform that allows users to visualize and assess the impact of environmental interventions—such as the deployment of artificial BioUrban trees—on urban air quality. Designed with usability and education in mind, the platform is targeted at researchers, urban planners, environmental enthusiasts, and the general public.

Features
Interactive simulation of pollution dynamics in a defined geographical area (e.g., 23,000 m²).

Adjustable environmental parameters: temperature, PM2.5, carbon monoxide, and artificial tree count.

Real-time insights page for exploring AQI data and pollution levels (dummy data used in the current phase).

Responsive and intuitive frontend with dynamic animations and clean layout.

Researcher dashboard with login access for advanced scenario evaluations.

Pages
Home – Introduction to the platform and its purpose.

Login – Secure login for general users and researchers.

Insights – Informative section with current air quality indicators.

Simulation – Core module to manipulate pollution variables and visualize outcomes.

Know More – Educational content on pollution sources and mitigation techniques.

Research Dashboard – Access-restricted section for researchers to test and analyze advanced models.

Technology Stack
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Vanilla and basic frameworks)

Backend: Under development (simulated data used in current release)

Tools & Frameworks: Responsive UI design, basic authentication handling, local storage for simulation
